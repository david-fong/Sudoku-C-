# Things To Do

- Run some repeated tests and get some performance data.
  - Report findings in the main readme file.
- Find a nice image to use for the repo's social preview.
- Try printing size of Tile with and without the fixedVal field
  - If it contributes significantly, find way to take it out?
- Try making traversal order not grid-row-major:
  - Sort ascending non-seeded num-options.
- Make Game ctor take arg for whether or not to print in pretty format.
  - This is so that the `printBar` function can adjust accordingly.
